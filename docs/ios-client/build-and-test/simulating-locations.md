# Simulating Locations

We can simulate locations on an iOS device and simulator when running the app.

To do this, we open the Scheme Editor (**Product** → **Scheme** → **Edit**), select **Run** in the left sidebar, select the **Options** tab and make sure the **Allow Location Simulation** checkmark is checked.

Then we can select a location from the **Default Location** dropdown or even load our own GPS file.

## Using the Simulator

Another way we can simulate location is with the simulator. From the menu, we select **Debug** → **Location** and select a location or enter a custom location.

## Using the Debug Console

Another way we can simulate location is with the debug console. Make sure the **Allow Location Simulation** checkmark is checked in the Scheme Editor. While running the app, we can click on the **Simulate Location** icon in the debug console and select a location.
