This is a community effort to bring the features of [Microsoft Soundscape](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/product/soundscape/) back to blind and visually-impaired travelers everywhere. Starting with the [components released as open source](https://github.com/microsoft/soundscape) by Microsoft Research, we have filled in some of the missing pieces and services to keep it functional.

## What was Microsoft Soundscape?

>Microsoft Soundscape \[was] a product from Microsoft Research that explored the use of innovative audio-based technology to enable people to build a richer awareness of their surroundings, thus becoming more confident and empowered to get around. Unlike step-by-step navigation apps, Soundscape uses 3D audio cues to enrich ambient awareness and provide a new way to relate to the environment. It allows you to build a mental map and make personal route choices while being more comfortable within unfamiliar spaces. Soundscape is designed to be used by everyone and live in the background; therefore, feel free to use it in conjunction with other apps such as podcasts, audio books, email and even GPS navigation!

For more technical details, see the [original README](https://github.com/microsoft/soundscape/blob/main/README.md) from the open-source Soundscape repository.
