/// This class builds and runs a graph of audio player nodes for playing all types of audio in
/// Soundscape. This includes 3D and 2D audio. All 3D audio is localized using the HRTF algorithm
/// built into Apple's `AVAudioEnvironmentNode`.
///
/// The node graph built by this object is completely dynamic. 2D audio players have their nodes
/// connected directly to the audio engine's main mixer node (which outputs to the speakers/headphones).
/// 3D audio players' nodes are connected to an environment node that is configured to work with audio at
/// the same sample rate as the 3D audio player. This means that there may be multiple environment nodes
/// (since there could be multiple 3D audio streams playing at different sample rates at the same time).
/// All environment nodes are then connected to the audio engine's main mixer node.

/// The audio engine can play both discrete audio (non-looped audio; see `DiscreteAudioPlayer` and
/// `AudioEngineAsset`) and continuous audio (looped audio; see `ContinuousAudioPlayer` and
/// `DynamicAudioEngineAsset`). When assets are passed into the audio engine using one of the various
/// `play(...)` methods, the appropriate type of audio player is created, attached to the engine, and
/// started. Discrete audio players are removed from the engine when they are done playing. Continuous
/// audio players are removed from the engine when `stop(_:)` is called with the id for the continuous
/// audio player. The audio engine has no knowledge of the implementation details of the various types
/// of audio in openscape as those details are fully encapsulated in the objects that implement
/// `AudioEngineAsset`, `Sound` (for discrete sounds), and/or `DynamicAudioEngineAsset` (for continuous
/// sounds) . See examples of this in `ClassicBeacon.swift`, `V2Beacon.swift`, `ContinuousTrack`, `WandAsset.swift`,
