/// This class acts as a filter for throttling the frequency of computation which is
/// initiated by various state change updates in openscape (e.g. geolocation updates).
/// With code that is dependent on location updates it is often unnecessary to run the code as
/// often state changes occur. For instance, it is unnecessary to make requests to the service
/// layer for new tiles every time a location update is delivered by iOS. For situations
/// like that, this class can be used to ensure a certain amount of time has past AND the
/// user has moved a minimum distance since the code was last run.
///
/// To use this class, instantiate an object with the minimum time and distance to use for
/// throttling. Call `shouldUpdate(location:)` each time a state change triggers your update code
/// to check if the update should be skipped or not. If `shouldUpdate(location:)` returns
/// `true` and you execute the code, then call `isUpdating(location:)`. When the code finishes
/// updating, call `didUpdate(success:)` to inform the filter object that the update has finished.
/// While an update is running, the filter will always return `false` from `shouldUpdate(location:)`
/// to prevent simultaneous updates.
