Soundscape for Everyone has been developed by a consortium of different organisations and individuals who were closely involved in the original app from Microsoft. It is built on the open-source repository made available by Microsoft following its decision to sunset Microsoft Soundscape. IA Labs is the partner making the submission on behalf of the consortium. Other partners include ONCE (Spain), Pixelspace (USA), N-Vibe (France), Okeenea (France), National Council for the Blind Ireland, Capital Region Nordic Alliance (USA), along with former members of the Microsoft Soundscape team, including the co-founders.
